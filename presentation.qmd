## Context {.smaller}

+ NHS England (nÃ©e Digital) operate various data services/collections for/from 
organisations receiving funds from the NHS in England
+ In 2021 NHS Digital changed how they assign records to an _individual_ within 
their hospital episode statistics (HES) datasets, the first change in 12 years
+ HES is a very widely used administrative health data collection in England, 
by
    + Providers
    + Commissioners
    + Researchers (inc. within the UK's national statistics institute)

## What are the HES datasets {.smaller}

+ event based records at the patient-activity level
+ for specific types of care provision
+ funded by the English NHS -OR- taking place in a NHS hospital in England.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%" .col-no-border}

### Admitted patient care (APC)

+ Admitted to hospital (inc. day case admissions)
+ Since 1989 but NHS Number only mandated since 1997
+ Additional HES Critical Care (CC) dataset available

:::
::: {.column width="33%" .col-left-border}

### Outpatient (OP) appointments

+ Attended and unattended
+ Since 2003

:::
::: {.column width="33%" .col-left-border}

### Accident and Emergency (A&E)

+ Non-admitted unscheduled(-ish) care at
    + Emergency Departments
    + Urgent Care Centres
    + Minor Injury Units
    + Walk-in Centres
+ From 2007 to 2020

:::
::::

## Data submitted used to identify patients within HES {.smaller}

+ NHS Number
+ Date of birth
+ Stated gender (though named `sex` and likely to have changed over time)
+ Postcode of patient place of residence
+ Local patient identifier
+ Local patient identifier provider (NHS Trust)

### What's not available

+ Names
+ Address precision better than postcode
    + 15 properties, but up to 100, per postcode.

## Person ID assignment algorithm (MPS) {background-color="#c5eafa"}

### MPS: Master Person Service

:::: {.columns}

Used across NHS Digital/England's "directed" data collections.

+ deterministic
+ stepwise
+ based on data available at the point of algorithm execution
+ __Links__ each HES record to - at most - one identity

## Data source

+ HES datasets
+ April 2007 - March 2020 (13 years)
+ Patients aged 55 or less at date of activity (i.e. must have date of birth)

Amounts to:

+ 979 million records

+ 55 million distinct Person IDs
+ 60 million distinct (HES ID, Person ID)-pairs

## Features investigated {.smaller}

First reported:

+ Age (grouped: Infants; Children; Young Adults; Adults)
+ Gender (Female or Male only^[Removed records for which gender not stated/unknown impacting only the "Split" category, for which this represents 5% of records.])
+ Ethnicity
+ Index of deprivation quintile
+ Year of activity

And:

+ Total number of activity records (grouped into quintiles)

## Results

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)


regression_results <- readRDS("data/regression_results.rds")

regression_results[, ':=' (est = exp(est_log),
                           est_low95 = exp(est_log - qnorm(0.975)*est_se_log),
                           est_high95 = exp(est_log + qnorm(0.975)*est_se_log))]


dodger = position_dodge(width = 0.5)

ggplot(regression_results, aes(y = est, x = param, colour = model)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = est_low95, ymax = est_high95),
                  position = dodger) +
    scale_x_discrete(limits=rev) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1.0, color = "blue") +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0),
                minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(y = "Odds ratio (logarithmic scale)", x = NULL) +
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0.1, 10)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Disscussion

+ Changes act at the fringes (91% records unchanged)
+ Most group wise differences are small
+ Greatest differences likely due to:
    + location information (as key component in linkage)
    + improved data recording / verification by Trusts
+ Deprivation still a factor
+ Reason for activity not investigated in this work
